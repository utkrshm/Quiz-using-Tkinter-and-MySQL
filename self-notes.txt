To get the number of right answers from the player_result table, use the following command:
        cur.execute('SELECT SUM(status) FROM PLAYER_RESULT;')
        no_right_answers = cur.fetchall()[0][0]

To get the number of wrong answers from the player_result table, use the following expression:
        no_wrong_answers = total_no_of_questions - no_right_answers

To get the percentage of correct answers from the player_result table, use the following command:
        cur.execute('SELECT ROUND(AVG(status)*100, 2) FROM PLAYER_RESULT;')
        percent_right_answers = cur.fetchall()[0][0]

Result Analysis is to be done after the current player's information has been added to the QUIZ_HISTORY table.
